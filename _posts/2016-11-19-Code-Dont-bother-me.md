Code Never bother me Anyway !!! <br>
Actually It was, not so much long before.
As a student from a small town & local university i never really focused on my coding skills back then.
This does not mean a student from small town & university couldn't code, actually most of my friends in
my college was very good at coding.
It was me who was never that much interested in it.
I used to focused on academics more than my practical coding skills.
Which i understood at the time of my first job as a php developer at pune.
Especially from my mentor swapnil, yes it was pretty much rough time for me.
I was very much careless back then, a little arogant as well.
I was very frustrated that time. Finally quit my job.
But that time something happen which changed me for good!
I had a few good friends who helped me out. Punjab my old friend & then Vishal who helped me a lot.
I learned most of the new things in programming from vishal.
I started from level zero. 
From Zed A Shaw's  Learn code the hard way.... It really helped me out.
& then from Introduction to Computer Science & Programming by MIT OCW.

Right now i am a computer science teacher & it really helped me out.
I even suggested it to my students also.
