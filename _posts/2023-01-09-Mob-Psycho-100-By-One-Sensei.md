Just a few days before i started to watch an outstanding anime series by the manga artist "One" or Tomohiro. As I already watched the anime One Punch Man by the same creator, I was very excited.  

Initially i did not keep my expectations very high from it, But somehow after watching the season 3 i'm surely like it more than OPM.  

**OPM Vs Mob Psycho 100:**  

First of all many peoples are comparing the two  anime's due to written by the same creator. Some are even saying mob is just a saitama with psychic powers, but when you start to watch the season 1, just after few episodes you'll realise the depth in the character writing and character development of each single character.  

Both stories are different One Punch Man is very exciting, fast paced, much more action oriented, Whereas Mob Psycho 100 is slow initially, it takes it time to develop the characters but as you progressed towards end of season 1 you'll find it exciting, engaging.  
  
Now You can watch all the episodes of Mob Psycho freely on Official YouTube Channel of Muse Asia or Muse India:
