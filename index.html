        <h1>Hello everyone, I'm Pradeep Ubale!</h1>
		<p>I'm a <em>Hobbyist programmer</em> . <a href="/about">Read more about my life...</a></p>
		<p>I like to teach, i am a computer science post graduate &amp  a teacher. 
			I am not a geek who sit in front of laptop for hours &amp hours to code.</p>
		<p>After my post-graduation i used to work in an IT company, but then i realized i was not 
			that much good in programming at that time. Honestly I got bored in that environment 
			So I left the company, after a long time 
			i decided that i have to follow my passion which is teaching.</p>
